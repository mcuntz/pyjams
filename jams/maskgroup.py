def maskgroup(x, n):
    """
        Masks elements in masked 1d-array gathered in groups of n elements.
        Retains any existing mask.

        For example for n=1: if an unmasked value is surrounded by two masked values, it will be masked as well.
        Or for n=2: two consecutive unmasked elements surrounded by masked elements will be masked.


        Definition
        ----------
        def maskgroup(x, n):


        Input
        -----
        x            1d-array
        n            int: any number <= n of consecutive unmasked data points surrounded by masked elements
                          should get masked


        Output
        ------
        new_mask     mask of x where additionally to the originally masked
                     elements, all elements are masked that are in a consecutive
                     group of data points with a length smaller equal to n


        Examples
        --------
        >>> # Create some data
        >>> x=np.ma.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12], mask=[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0])

        >>> # mask all elements which are gathered in groups smaller then 3
        >>> new_mask = maskgroup(x,2)
        >>> # apply new mask to x
        >>> print(np.ma.array(x.data, mask=new_mask))
        [-- 2 3 4 5 -- 7 8 9 -- -- --]

        >>> # mask all elements with are gathered in groups smaller equal to 3
        >>> new_mask = maskgroup(x,3)
        >>> # apply new mask to x
        >>> print(np.ma.array(x.data, mask=new_mask))
        [-- 2 3 4 5 -- -- -- -- -- -- --]
